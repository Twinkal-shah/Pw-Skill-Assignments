Callbacks and Promises are both mechanisms used for managing asynchronous code in JavaScript, but they have different approaches and characteristics. Here's a comparison between the two:

Callbacks:

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, to be executed later once an asynchronous operation completes.
They have been widely used in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations for a long time.
Callbacks can lead to callback hell or pyramid of doom, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations or error handling.
Nested callbacks can make code difficult to read, understand, and maintain due to the inversion of control and loss of linear flow.
Error handling with callbacks can become cumbersome, as errors need to be propagated manually through each callback in the chain.
Callbacks are prone to issues such as callback hell, race conditions, and callback inversion.
Promises:

Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
They provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.
Promises allow chaining of asynchronous operations using .then() method, which leads to a more readable and linear code structure.
Promises provide built-in error handling through the .catch() method, allowing centralized error handling at the end of the promise chain.
Promises support multiple asynchronous operations in parallel using methods like Promise.all() and Promise.race().
Promises allow separation of concerns by decoupling the code that initiates an asynchronous operation from the code that handles its result or error.
Promises introduce new syntax and concepts that may require a learning curve for developers who are not familiar with them.
Reasons why Promises are preferred for managing asynchronous code:

Readability: Promises provide a more readable and maintainable way to write asynchronous code, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations or complex error handling scenarios.
Avoiding callback hell: Promises help avoid callback hell by allowing asynchronous operations to be chained together in a more linear and structured manner.
Error handling: Promises offer built-in error handling through the .catch() method, making it easier to handle errors in asynchronous code and reducing the likelihood of errors being overlooked or mishandled.
Composition: Promises support composition of asynchronous operations, making it easier to create complex asynchronous workflows by chaining multiple promises together.
Native support: Promises are natively supported in modern JavaScript environments, making them a standard and widely adopted approach for managing asynchronous code.
Overall, while callbacks have been a traditional way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, Promises offer significant advantages in terms of readability, error handling, and composability, making them the preferred choice for managing asynchronous code in modern JavaScript applications. Additionally, with the introduction of async/await in JavaScript, which builds upon Promises, asynchronous code can be written in an even more synchronous style, further improving readability and maintainability.
