    <P>
        A favicon is a small icon or image associated with a website, typically displayed in the browser's address bar, next to the site's name in a list of bookmarks, and on browser tabs. It serves as a visual representation of the website or brand and helps users quickly identify and distinguish the site among others.</P>
